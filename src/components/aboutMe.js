            <p class="">Dedicated Web Developer with a passion for creativity! I enjoy helping others achieve their dreams by creating the best possible content for their businesses. I am currently shooting for a certification from the University of Minnesota Full Stack Bootcamp! <br /><br />
            I absolutely love collaborating with others towards an end goal, while watching a seemingly impossible project come to fruition! <br /><br /> In my spare time you'll find me reading, playing chess, spending time with my two cats, and allocating a few hours a week keeping up with the newest trends and frameworks in the industry. While making a pivot from the hospitality industry, I bring along an importance toward the client and the team, understanding that nothing is possible without a positive attitude and successful communication towards both groups.</p>
